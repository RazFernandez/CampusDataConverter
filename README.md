# JSON to CSV Automation Program

## üéØ Main Objective

The objective of this project is to develop an automation program
written in **Java** that converts **JSON files into CSV format** in a
reliable, efficient, and scalable way.\
The program is designed for academic environments where structured data
management is crucial, enabling universities to streamline data
processing and improve accessibility for analysis and reporting.

## üåç Vision

Our vision is to provide a robust and user-friendly tool that bridges
the gap between **hierarchical JSON data** and **tabular CSV
structures**.\
By doing so, we aim to support better decision-making in educational
institutions through simplified data transformation, ensuring
interoperability and adaptability in diverse systems.

## üìå Problem Context

At universities, data is often exchanged in **JSON format** due to its
flexibility and compatibility with modern applications.\
However, many academic and administrative processes, including reporting
and statistical analysis, require data in **CSV format** for integration
with spreadsheets, research tools, and legacy systems.

The lack of an efficient conversion mechanism creates **bottlenecks,
manual errors, and inconsistencies** in data handling.\
This project addresses this problem by automating the **JSON-to-CSV
conversion process**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

-   **Java**: Core programming language for implementation.\
-   **JSON Processing Libraries**: To parse and handle JSON structures.\
-   **CSV Writer Utilities**: For structured data export.\
-   **JUnit**: For isolated and integrated testing.\
-   **GitHub**: For version control, repository setup, and
    collaboration.\
-   **Markdown & JavaDoc**: For documentation and project transparency.
