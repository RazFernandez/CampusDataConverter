## Lessons Learned from the JSON-to-CSV Converter Project

This project represented a major step forward in the acquisition of knowledge, since at the beginning there were no skills in certain areas that turned out to be fundamental during its development. Although the Java language was not completely new, building a functional application helped reinforce practice in areas such as the use of collections, the creation of recursive methods, and file handling. At the same time, experience was expanded into the development of graphical interfaces using Swing, as well as the creation of a simple but functional desktop application.

One of the most relevant learnings was the incorporation of Maven as a dependency management tool. Through the pom.xml file, it became clear how this technology facilitates the integration of external libraries, the automation of downloads, and the proper organization of projects. This knowledge opened the door to a more modern and professional development style, where libraries such as Gson and OpenCSV could be easily integrated, improving both quality and maintainability.

A key aspect of the process was the decision to replace the org.json library with Gson. The former did not guarantee a consistent order of JSON objects, which made conversion to CSV unpredictable. Gson, on the other hand, offered a more stable and ordered handling of keys, ensuring consistent results. This technical decision made it possible to achieve a reliable data transformation process, demonstrating the importance of carefully evaluating and selecting the right tools for a project.

From a technical perspective, the development of the recursive algorithm to flatten JSON structures into a CSV format represented a significant achievement. Strategies were designed to handle different cases: objects that expand with prefixed keys, arrays of primitives that generate individual rows, arrays of objects that produce multiple records, and scalar or null values that are converted into direct assignments. This process enabled a deeper understanding of how structured data can be represented and correctly transformed into a tabular format.

The project also highlighted the importance of documentation and effective communication. Flowcharts, explanations, and manuals in Markdown format were created to make the logic understandable both for technical profiles and for non-specialized users. This reinforced the idea that successful software does not only depend on its code but also on the clarity with which its functioning is communicated.

Finally, a simple yet functional desktop interface was designed, integrating features such as file and folder selection, status labels, and action buttons that followed the correct user flow. These details enhanced the user experience and demonstrated the importance of planning the user journey within the application. The addition of error messages and success confirmations contributed to the feeling of a complete and reliable tool.

In conclusion, this project represented a consolidation of previous knowledge in Java while also introducing new practices such as dependency management with Maven and informed technical decision-making. Beyond the technical aspects, it offered the opportunity to deepen the understanding of processing JSON structures and building recursive algorithms, while also emphasizing the essential role of design, documentation, and user experience. The knowledge gained through this project lays a solid foundation for tackling more complex challenges in the future and encourages continuous improvement as a developer.
